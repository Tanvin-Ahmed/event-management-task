# Event Management System

A modern event management application built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This application allows users to browse, create, and RSVP to events with a clean and responsive interface.

## üîó Live Demo

**[View Live Application](https://event-management-task-delta.vercel.app)**

> **Note:**
>
> In the requirements document (Module 4), it was suggested to save created events in local state or local storage. However, I chose to store created events in the backend `eventsData` array instead. This approach is more efficient and enables features such as server-side rendering (SSR) for the event details page. By maintaining events in the backend, the application ensures better scalability, data consistency, and a more robust user experience. I think it is more realistic and in real world application event should be saved in backend.
